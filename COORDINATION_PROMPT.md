## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### **Queue Integration Pattern:**
All new services should integrate with the existing Bull queue system:
```javascript
// Example integration pattern already established:
const { contentCreationQueue, videoPublishingQueue } = require('../config/queues');

// Queue a video publishing job
await videoPublishingQueue.add('publish-video', {
  content_id: contentId,
  video_path: videoPath,
  metadata: videoMetadata
});
```

### **Database Integration Pattern:**
Follow the established pattern for database operations:
```javascript
const { db } = require('../config/database');

// Update content status
await db.query(
  'UPDATE content_items SET status = $1, published_url = $2 WHERE id = $3',
  ['published', publishedUrl, contentId]
);
```

### **Error Handling & Logging:**
Use the established logging and error handling patterns:
```javascript
const { logger } = require('../utils/logger');

try {
  // Implementation
  logger.info('Operation completed successfully');
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed:', error);
  throw error;
}
```
