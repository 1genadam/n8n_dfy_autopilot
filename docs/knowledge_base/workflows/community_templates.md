## Template Implementation Patterns

### 1. Import and Configuration
```bash
# Steps to implement community templates
1. Download JSON workflow file
2. Import into n8n instance
3. Configure credentials for each node
4. Customize parameters for your use case
5. Test with sample data
6. Activate for production use
```

### 2. Customization Guidelines
```javascript
// Common customization areas
const customizationAreas = {
  credentials: "Replace with your API keys and tokens",
  endpoints: "Update URLs to match your services",
  parameters: "Adjust timing, limits, and thresholds",
  logic: "Modify conditional statements and routing",
  data_mapping: "Adapt field mappings to your data structure"
};
```

### 3. Best Practices for Template Usage
```javascript
// Template implementation checklist
const implementationChecklist = [
  "Review all credential requirements",
  "Understand data flow and transformations",
  "Test with non-production data first",
  "Document any customizations made",
  "Set up monitoring and error handling",
  "Plan for scaling and maintenance"
];
```
